# ðŸ’³ Fraud Analytics: Identifying Anomalous Financial Behavior



A complete end-to-end fraud detection project built using the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. This project simulates a real-world data analyst task: performing deep exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing data, engineering informative features, reducing high-dimensional variables using PCA, and modeling with tuned machine learning algorithms â€” all with a strong business-oriented narrative.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

In this project, I worked with a large-scale transactional dataset with both transaction and identity information. The key objective was to identify fraudulent transactions while explaining the analytical process clearly â€” as would be needed in a real business environment.

### âœ… Techniques Used:
- Data cleaning, missing value imputation, and outlier handling
- Univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Feature engineering (log transformations, group ratios, time-based features)
- Dimensionality reduction using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Classification modeling with:
  - **Logistic Regression** (baseline)
  - **Random Forest** (tuned)
- Model evaluation using:
  - ROC AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve
