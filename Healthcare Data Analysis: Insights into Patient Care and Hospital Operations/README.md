# üè• Healthcare Data Analysis: Insights into Patient Care and Hospital Operations

A complete SQL-based data analytics project that explores medical conditions, hospital operations, patient demographics, insurance billing, and diagnostic performance using a real-world healthcare dataset. The project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis using T-SQL ‚Äî from preprocessing to actionable business insights.

## üìå Project Summary

This healthcare data analytics project investigates patient demographics, admission trends, hospital utilization, doctor workload, test outcomes, and financial billing data. By performing deep exploratory analysis using SQL, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of healthcare service delivery and identify critical areas for operational improvement and policy decision-making.

- Data cleaning and standardization (gender values, billing correction)
- Removal of duplicates using `ROW_NUMBER` and `CTE`
- Case-based grouping (age segmentation)
- Aggregation and descriptive statistics
- Hospital and doctor-level performance insights
- Billing and insurance provider analysis
- Stored procedure for blood-type matching
