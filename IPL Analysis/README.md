# 🏏 IPL Performance Analytics Dashboard (Power BI Project)

This is a Power BI project I developed to analyze Indian Premier League (IPL) data, with the goal of uncovering key patterns across players, teams, venues, and match performance. It demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards, statistical analysis, and advanced data modeling.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

I collected and cleaned IPL match data from publicly available sources and built a comprehensive data model using Power BI. The project includes creating calculated columns and DAX measures, designing visuals to explore match outcomes, player stats, and team performance, and delivering it all through an intuitive and responsive dashboard interface.

## ✅ Tools & Techniques I Used

- **Power BI Desktop** for report building and publishing  
- **Power Query Editor** for data transformation and cleaning  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to create KPIs and custom metrics  
- **Interactive Visuals** (charts, slicers, tables, and cards) to allow deep data exploration  
- **Dashboard Design** aligned with storytelling principles and usability best practices

## 🛠️ How I Built This

### 🔹 Step 1: Data Collection

- I downloaded historical IPL data from Kaggle and other public repositories.

### 🔹 Step 2: Data Cleaning & Transformation

- I used Power Query to handle missing values, rename columns, and normalize team/player names.

### 🔹 Step 3: Modeling & Measures

- I defined relationships between tables and wrote DAX measures to calculate:
  - Total runs, wickets
  - Win/loss percentages
  - Toss vs match outcomes
  - Player-level performance indicators

### 🔹 Step 4: Dashboard Creation

- I designed interactive visuals to compare team and player performance across seasons, explore venue-specific trends, and slice by year, team, or match type.
